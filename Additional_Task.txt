1) Explain the reason of having both nonceHash and nonceNumHash in the smart
  contract. Can any of these two be omitted and why?

Can't be removed. If one of them is removed, it will cause a security vulnerability

2) Try to find out any security loopholes in the above design and propose an
   improved solution.

   When creating a smart contract, the lottery number cannot be directly passed in,
   which is easy to cause unfairness and insecurity of the game. Generate a lottery random number on the lottery day
